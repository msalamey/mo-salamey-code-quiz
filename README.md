In this assignment I created a website for a timed quiz using JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores. 

## Actions taken:
* Utilized JavaScript to create variables and arrays for those variables. The data contained in the variables with questions, choices and answers.  
* Utilized functions to the questions, choices, and for selecting the correct answers; as well as for the timer. 
* Utilized "if/else" for the choice selection against the correct answer. 
* Utilized additional variables and the event listener to respond to "clicks." 
* Utilized the "stringify" method for storing and pulling high scores and initials.
